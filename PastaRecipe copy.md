## **Putting it all together**
1. Finely dice your onion, bell pepper, and garlic cloves.
1. Turn a stove burner on high. Fill a medium-sized pot with enough water to cover your pasta and add 1 tsp. of kosher salt. Place the pot of water on the stove burner you just turned on.
    * While executing the following steps, this water will begin to boil. Once it is at a rolling boil, add the pasta. Set a timer for what the package recommends for al dente pasta and stir the pasta occassionally to prevent clumped pasta. Once the timer goes off, reserve 1/2 a cup of the starchy pasta water and remove the pasta to drain over the sink, rinsing in cold water to stop cooking.
1. Turn a different stove burner on medium to medium-high. Place a large sautee pan on top of this burner.
1. Add 1 tsp. of your oil and carefully place the ground sausage in the pan. Flatten the ground sausage out on the pan so that it forms one layer that can begin to brown.
1. After 2-4 minutes of browning the sausage, add your diced onion, bell pepper, garlic, and the remaining 1 tsp. of oil to the pan. Mix well to get all of the sausage off of the bottom of the pan and ensure that all of the vegetables have oil on them. 
    * At this point, you can optionally add 1 tsp. of kosher salt to the pan to help draw moisture out of the vegetables so that they will soften and cook quicker.
1. Stir the pan often, letting the vegetables soften and the sausage finish cooking all of the way through. At this point, your water will likely start to boil so follow the directions listed under Step 2.
1. Once the onions have turned translucent and the sausage is cooked through, reduce the heat to medium-low and add your crushed tomatoes, the remaining salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and basil leaves - mixing thoroughly. 
1. Allow the spices to infuse in the sauce for 1 to 2 minutes. After that, add the al dente pasta to the sauce and mix so that all pieces are covered in the sauce. If the sauce is too runny or watery at the bottom of the pan, the add splashes of the reserved pasta water to slowly thicken and bring the sauce together. 
1. Once the sauce is at a thickness to your liking, turn the burner off, remove the pan from the stove, and plate your dish. You can optionally top the pasta with a little fresh ground black pepper, more basil leaves, and/or crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat.
1. Enjoy!

### Notes
* If making the sauce in a non-stick sautee pan with a Teflon coating, do not use metal utensils to stir or else small pieces of toxic Teflon will end up in your sauce. Instead, use a silicon, rubber, or plastic spatula that will not scrape the pan.

### Common **FAQ**

>Q: Do you need to add Italian sausage?
>
>A: No, you can make this dish without the steps for browning the Italian sausage and still have a delicious dish. However, the Italian sausage does add a lot of flavor to the sauce. So, its up to you.

>Q: How long should I cook my pasta?
>
>A: The box that your pasta of choice came in likely provides a time estimate for how long it should take to cook, say 9-11 minutes. Cook your pasta to a point of al dente and remove at the 9 minute mark, and the rest of the cooking will be done in the sauce later.

>Q: Can this recipe be used for more than 2 servings?
>
>A: Of course, just double the ingredients! The only problem you might run into is fitting all of the pasta into the sautee pan when mixing with the sauce. If this is going to be a problem, cook the pasta for the full amount of time and do not add it to the sautee pan of sauce. When plating, place down a bed of pasta and then top with your sauce.
